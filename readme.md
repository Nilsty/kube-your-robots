# Welcome to Containerize your robots and run them on Kubernetes
## A workshop part of [RoboCon 2024](https://robocon.io/). 
Presented by [Markus Stahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-s-47385134/) and [Nils Balkow-Tychsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilsty/)


#### This repository contains all workshop materials. This readme should guide us through our workshop day. 

We will start with the [fundamentals of Docker including examples related to Robot Framework](10-docker/readme.md). 

Afterwards we will [dive deep into Kubernetes by exploring its capabilities in a hands on demo](20-kubernetes/readme.md). 

You will then apply your learnings by building a Docker container and a Kubernetes manifest for a Robot Framework test. We'll work out a solution together during the workshop. For the discussion there is a [prepared example test](30-example/readme.md). 

Finally we will talk about [running tests in parallel on top of Kubernetes](40-parallelization/readme.md).
