# Welcome to Containerize your robots and run them on Kubernetes
A workshop part of [RoboCon 2024](https://robocon.io/). 
Given by [Markus Stahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-s-47385134/) and [Nils Balkow-Tychsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilsty/)

This repository should guide us through our workshop day and it also contains all workshop materials.

We will start with the fundamentals of Docker including examples related to Robot Framework [here](10-docker/readme.md). 

Afterwards will dive deep into Kubernetes by exploring its capabilities in a hands on [demo](20-kubernetes/readme.md). 

You will then be tasks to apply your learnings by building a Docker container and a Kubernetes manifest for a Robot Framework test. There is a [prepared example](30-example/readme.md) where we'll work out a solution together during the workshop.

Finally we should talk about running tests in parallel on top of Kubernetes. You can find all the details in [here](40-parallelization/readme.md).
